# String Operations in C

This repository provides user-defined functions in C for various string operations:

- **Display Character Using ASCII**
  - `displayAscii(char character)`: Displays the ASCII value of the given character.

- **Count Capital Letters**
  - `countCapital(char* str)`: Counts uppercase letters in a string.

- **Count Lowercase Letters**
  - `countLower(char* str)`: Counts lowercase letters in a string.

- **Count Vowels**
  - `countVowels(char* str)`: Counts vowels in a string.

- **Count Whitespace Characters**
  - `countWhitespace(char* str)`: Counts whitespace characters in a string.

- **Replace Characters**
  - `replaceChar(char* str, char findChar, char replaceChar)`: Replaces occurrences of `findChar` with `replaceChar` in `str`.

- **Toggle Case**
  - `toggleCase(char* str)`: Toggles case of letters in `str`.

- **Last Occurrence of Character**
  - `lastOccurrence(char* str, char character)`: Finds last occurrence of `character` in `str`.

- **First Occurrence of Character**
  - `firstOccurrence(char* str, char character)`: Finds first occurrence of `character` in `str`.

- **Count Occurrences of a Specific Character**
  - `countOccurrences(char* str, char character)`: Counts occurrences of `character` in `str`.

## Usage

Include `string_operations.h` in your C program and link it with `string_operations.c`. Compile with appropriate flags.
